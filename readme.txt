# Notes

	- Before installing the plugin, please think about your point system (>Admin >Points). The points should not change over time, as the plugin stores recent userpoints every month. If you change userpoints later on, the userscores shown for the recent month could be incorrect (or even negative).
	- When the plugin got installed, the widget will be empty. Wait for the first score event (question, answer, vote) and you will see the users listed in the widget.
